# PixelSketch: Art at Your Fingertips

**Note:** PixelSketch is an ongoing project and is still in development!

Welcome to **PixelSketch**! I created this browser-based tool that combines the fun of a sketchpad with the nostalgia of an Etch A Sketch.

## Features

- **Hover & Draw**: On desktop, simply hover over the pad to draw! Left-clicking is also supported. On mobile, just touch the screen to create.
- **Color Customization**: Choose your favorite colors to personalize your drawings.
- **Rainbow Mode**: Activate a vibrant rainbow mode that randomly changes colors as you draw for a fun, dynamic effect.
- **Eraser Mode**: Erase specific areas of your artwork with ease.
- **Clear Button**: Quickly erase all drawings with a simple click.
- **Customizable Grid**: Start with a default 16x16 grid of square divs, with the option to resize up to 100x100 for more detailed creations.
