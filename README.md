# PixelSketch: Art at Your Fingertips

Welcome to **PixelSketch**! I created this browser-based tool that combines the fun of a sketchpad with the nostalgia of an Etch A Sketch.

## Features

- **Hover & Draw**: On desktop, simply hover over the pad to draw! Left-clicking is also supported. On mobile, just touch the screen to create.
- **Color Customization**: Choose your favorite colors to personalize your drawings.
- **Rainbow Mode**: Activate a vibrant rainbow mode that randomly changes colors as you draw for a fun, dynamic effect.
